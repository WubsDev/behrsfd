    <textOnly>Hi {!if(Lead.FirstName=&quot;&quot;, Contact.FirstName,Lead.FirstName)},

I want to invite you to stop by the BehrPro booth #C1047 if you&apos;ll be at the NAHB International Builder Show (IBS) next week. You don&apos;t want to miss the great tips, demos and giveaways at our booth if you are planning to be at the show.

We also have a special 30-minute presentation I know {!if(Account.Name=&quot;&quot;, Lead.Company,Account.Name)} could benefit from, called BEHR Paint Essentials: How Raising the Spec Can Help Lower Costs. That&apos;s on Tuesday, so be sure to stop by Multifamily Central at 9am for that in room #N255 if you&apos;re around.

You can even schedule a 20-min. one-on-one version of this presentation at the booth and get a free power pack for your time. Learn more or self-schedule an appointment online: http://pro.behr.com/ibs2014appointment

Please give me a call at {!if(Contact.OwnerPhone=&quot;&quot;, Lead.OwnerPhone,Contact.OwnerPhone)} if you plan on coming by. We would love to see you at the show {!if(Lead.FirstName=&quot;&quot;, Contact.FirstName,Lead.FirstName)}.

Sincerely,
